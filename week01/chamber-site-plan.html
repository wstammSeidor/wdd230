            <h2>Image carousel with success case descriptions</h2>
            <p>The color palette would be in a range of blue tones, as it tends to provide a more professional appearance.</p>
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The typography would be Roboto, as it is a very legible font and it is also very versatile.</p>
